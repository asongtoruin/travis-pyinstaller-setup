# Travis-PyInstaller Setup
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/asongtoruin/travis-pyinstaller-setup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/asongtoruin/travis-pyinstaller-setup)
A simple set-up for using Travis, Pyinstaller and Github Releases to distribute
(Windows!) executables

Getting PyInstaller, Travis and Github Releases to work in sync to automatically
distribute windows binaries is a bit of a faff. This repo is a minimal set-up to
show how they can be linked together.
